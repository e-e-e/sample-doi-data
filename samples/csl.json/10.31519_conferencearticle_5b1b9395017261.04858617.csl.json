By the study of topographic maps, satellite images and field research, the various types of coasts were identified: mud flats, salt marshes, sandy or cliffed coasts, and islands. Moreover the interpretation of seismic profiles, has led to recognize so important morphological features in the lake bed, such as: erosive channels, colos, mud volcanoes, the raised sandy masses and under water mounts. The main results illustrate the variable morphological behavior of Urmia Lake in different parts of the lake.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.31519\/conferencearticle_5b1b9395017261.04858617","type":"paper-conference","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,9]],"date-time":"2018-06-09T12:01:01Z","timestamp":1528545661000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"GLOBAL WARMING IMPACT ON URMIA LAKE VULNERABILITY AND HAZARD","prefix":"10.31519","author":[{"given":"Homayoun","family":"Khoshravan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Head of coastal management group and associated professor of water research institute, ministry of Energy"}]},{"given":"Homayoun","family":"Khoshravan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Head of coastal management group and associated professor of water research institute, ministry of Energy"}]}],"member":"15171","reference":[{"key":"ref1","unstructured":"Amini A., 2009, The study on sedimentary deposition of Urmia lake in the margin of shahid kalantari high way, earth science journal, No: 74, PP 57-68, Amini A., 2009, The study on sedimentary deposition of Urmia lake in the margin of shahid kalantari high way, earth science journal, No: 74, PP 57-68"},{"key":"ref2","unstructured":"Horikawa K., 1988, Nearshore dynamics and coastal processes.
