The apparently good news is that people report that they have very positive attitudes to environmentally-friendly products and they also consistently say that they are prepared to adapt their behavior to ameliorate the effects of climate change. However, numerous studies have found little behavior change on the part of consumers. This study investigates this critical issue experimentally. It does this by exploring whether self-reported attitudes to low carbon products, or alternatively implicit attitudes to such products (measured using an associative task and not requiring self-report), predict consumer choice of products varying on a range of dimensions including environmental consequences, in an experimental context where time for selection was also systematically varied. We found firstly, in line with previous research, that human beings have explicit and implicit attitudes that are not correlated. Secondly, in terms of brand choice, we found that consumers are particularly sensitive to both brand information and value in their selection of products, particularly under time pressure. Organic\/eco brands are, however, much less favoured, especially under any time pressure, where processes that are more automatic prevail. Thirdly, color-coded carbon footprint information can influence choice even under time pressure but only for those consumers with a strong positive<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1515\/sem-2015-0109","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,6]],"date-time":"2016-10-06T07:56:35Z","timestamp":1475740595000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Consumption and climate change: Why we say one thing but do another in the face of our greatest threat","prefix":"10.1515","volume":"2016","author":[{"given":"Geoffrey","family":"Beattie","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Laura","family":"McGuire","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"374","reference":[{"key":"ref231","author":"Zeithaml","volume":"52","year":"2008","article-title":"Consumer perceptions of price , quality and value : A means - end model and synthesis of evidence","journal-title":"Journal of Marketing"},{"key":"ref191","author":"Upham","first-page":"19","year":"2011","article-title":"Carbon labelling of grocery products : Public perceptions and potential emissions reductions","journal-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production"},{"key":"ref91","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"181","DOI":"10.1108\/03090560710718175","article-title":"International marketing behavior amongst exporting firms","volume":"41","author":"Rundh","year":"2007","journal-title":"European Journal of Marketing"},{"key":"ref151","author":"Sloman","first-page":"119","year":"1996","article-title":"The empirical case for two systems of reasoning Psychological","journal-title":"Bulletin"},{"key":"ref41","author":"Magnusson","first-page":"103","year":"2001","article-title":"Kaisa Koivisto & Per - Olow Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n Attitudes towards organic foods among Swedish consumers","journal-title":"British Food Journal"},{"key":"ref51","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"583","DOI":"10.1037\/a0014649","article-title":"Weak criticisms and selective evidence : Reply to","volume":"94","author":"McConnell","year":"2009","journal-title":"Journal of Applied Psychology"},{"key":"ref61","first-page":"1","article-title":"Expedmentelle beitrage zur lehre vom gedachtni Zeitschrift","volume":"1","author":"Muller","year":"1900","journal-title":"Psychologie"},{"key":"ref201","first-page":"169","article-title":"Wim Verbeke Sustainable food consumption : Exploring the consumer attitude behavioral intention gap Journal of Agricultural and Environmental","volume":"19","author":"Vermeir","year":"2006","journal-title":"Ethics"},{"key":"ref81","author":"Roos","first-page":"113","year":"2011","article-title":"Challenges of carbon labelling of food products : A consumer research perspective","journal-title":"British Food Journal"},{"key":"ref11","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"58","DOI":"10.1177\/0146167295211007","article-title":"Attitudes and the prediction of behavior : A meta - analysis of the empirical literature","volume":"21","author":"Kraus","year":"1995","journal-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin"},{"key":"ref101","first-page":"954","article-title":"Of two minds : Forming and changing valence - inconsistent implicit and explicit attitudes Psychological","volume":"17","author":"Rydell","year":"2006","journal-title":"Science"},{"key":"ref161","first-page":"165","article-title":"Is the implicit association test immune to faking ?
