Although certain stances of Fanon and Said, with their focus on cultural strategies of domination and resistance, have a currency in Middle Eastern studies, no literary theorist, folklorist, anthropologist, political scientist or historian in the field of Middle Eastern Studies, so far as I am aware, explicitly draws upon Subaltern Studies with any consistency as an organizing principle for his or her studies. It is the Latin Americanists (and to a lesser degree Africanists) who have been most eager to build on South Asian Subaltern Studies to respond to Latin American (or subsanaran African) circumstances. Perhaps it is time to take a closer look at what Subaltern Studies might contribute to Middle Eastern studies if we were to make a sustained effort to apply and critique that body of literature.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0026318400034830","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,10]],"date-time":"2016-03-10T17:05:08Z","timestamp":1457629508000},"page":"11-16","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Middle East Studies & Subaltern Studies","prefix":"10.1017","volume":"31","author":[{"given":"Sabra J.","family":"Webber","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,9]]},"container-title":"Middle East Studies Association Bulletin","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/S0026318400034830","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,23]],"date-time":"2017-04-23T00:29:27Z","timestamp":1492907367000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,7]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1997,7]]},"issue":"01"},"alternative-id":["S0026318400034830"],"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/s0026318400034830","relation":{},"ISSN":["0026-3184","2329-3233"],"container-title-short":"Middle East Stud.
