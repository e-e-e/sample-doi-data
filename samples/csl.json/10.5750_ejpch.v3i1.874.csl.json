Most but not all parents follow these recommendations. This study aimed to characterize the non-adherent mothers in order to understand the reasons behind that non-adherence. Study design: All mothers who refused any routine treatment of their infant or who asked for early discharge of their infant were included. They completed a questionnaire on socio-economic items, previous births and those children\u2019s health status, current pregnancy and delivery and their beliefs. Results: Three non-adherent subgroups emerged according to the responses: Muslim mothers requesting early discharge to care for children at home, Jewish mothers requesting early discharge because they disliked the hospital environment, Sabbath\/holiday and children at home and Jewish mothers who rejected guidelines because they believed the treatments were unnecessary or possibly harmful to their infants. Conclusion: Socio-economic factors could influence maternal adherence to care guidelines in a well-baby nursery. Several interventions to enhance maternal adherence to medical recommendations are proposed in order to increase the child and family centeredness of clinical and social care.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5750\/ejpch.v3i1.874","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,13]],"date-time":"2016-10-13T12:09:05Z","timestamp":1476360545000},"page":"71","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Maternal non-compliance in a well-baby nursery: family characteristics and other reasons","prefix":"10.5750","volume":"3","author":[{"given":"Erez","family":"Nadir","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vered","family":"Nir","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sylvia","family":"Foldi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Amit","family":"Hochberg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Michael","family":"Feldman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"3758","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,11]]},"container-title":"European Journal for Person Centered Healthcare","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/bjll.org\/index.php\/ejpch\/article\/viewFile\/874\/pdf_118","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/bjll.org\/index.php\/ejpch\/article\/viewFile\/874\/pdf_118","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,13]],"date-time":"2016-10-13T12:10:33Z","timestamp":1476360633000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,11]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,17]]},"issue":"1"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5750\/ejpch.v3i1.874","relation":{},"ISSN":["2052-5656","2052-5648"],"container-title-short":"EJPCH"}
