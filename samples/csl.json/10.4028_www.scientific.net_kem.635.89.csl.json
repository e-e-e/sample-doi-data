The materials are heat treated to achieve high hardness for higher abrasion wear resistance. An additional increase of the materials abrasion wear resistance can be achieved by applying nitridation with diffusion annealing of the material surface. The paper deals about the influence of the material purity, his chemical composition on the process of diffusion, the quality of the nitrided layer of a vacuum smelted steel B\u043e\u0308hler W400 VMR and a chromium steel X210Cr12.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/kem.635.89","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,11]],"date-time":"2014-12-11T15:04:09Z","timestamp":1418310249000},"page":"89-93","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Possibilities of Preparing Tools Working in Conditions of Abrasion Wear with the Modification of the Tool Surfaces by Nitridation","prefix":"10.4028","volume":"635","author":[{"given":"Martin","family":"Ore\u010dn\u00fd","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Techical University in Ko\u0161ice"}]},{"given":"Petra","family":"Lackov\u00e1","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Techical University in Ko\u0161ice"}]},{"given":"Mari\u00e1n","family":"Bur\u0161\u00e1k","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Techical University in Ko\u0161ice"}]}],"member":"2457","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2014,12]]},"container-title":"Key Engineering Materials","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.scientific.net\/KEM.635.89.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,6]],"date-time":"2018-05-06T11:00:19Z","timestamp":1525604419000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,12]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/kem.635.89","relation":{},"ISSN":["1662-9795"],"container-title-short":"KEM"}
