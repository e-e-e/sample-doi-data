At this point, Highway 14A begins a torturous seven-mile ascent along a 10 percent grade, rising ever higher into sweet clover and green meadows, spruce trees and lodgepole pines.

But, if you follow the small National Forest sign off to the left near the summit and walk another mile and a half after parking the car, you come to what seems to be the top of the world: the Great Medicine Wheel, high in the Big-horn Mountains, an ancient eighty-foot diameter circle of rocks with a cairn in the center and twenty-eight spokes radiating out to the rim.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525\/rac.2001.11.1.53","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,2,4]],"date-time":"2004-02-04T14:55:14Z","timestamp":1075906514000},"page":"53-81","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Giving Voice to Place: Three Models for Understanding American Sacred Space","prefix":"10.1017","volume":"11","author":[{"given":"Belden C.","family":"Lane","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,18]]},"reference":[{"key":"S1052115100000477_ref037","DOI":"10.2307\/1051348","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"S1052115100000477_ref013","first-page":"18","journal-title":"American Sacred Space,"},{"key":"S1052115100000477_ref050","DOI":"10.1017\/S0360966900027912","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"S1052115100000477_ref041","volume":"25","first-page":"171","year":"1993","journal-title":"World Archaeology"},{"key":"S1052115100000477_ref051","volume":"2","first-page":"154","year":"1993","journal-title":"Continuum"},{"key":"S1052115100000477_ref018","first-page":"26","journal-title":"The Sacred and the Profane,"}],"container-title":"Religion and American Culture: A Journal of Interpretation","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/S1052115100000477","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,2]],"date-time":"2018-07-02T02:15:56Z","timestamp":1530497756000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"references-count":6,"journal-issue":{"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"issue":"01"},"alternative-id":["S1052115100000477"],"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1525\/rac.2001.11.1.53","relation":{"cites":[]},"ISSN":["1052-1151","1533-8568"],"subject":["Religious studies","Cultural Studies"],"container-title-short":"Relig.
