The electromagnetic actuators-based multisources complex excitations active vibration isolation system is built. Additionally, in view of the complex structure and strong coupling of the system, the least-squares method to identify and obtain the mathematical model of the vibration isolation system is adopted. Furthermore, this paper also sets up the acceleration feedback-based PID control model for multisources complex excitations active vibration isolation system, proposes an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm of dynamic inertia weight factors used to optimize parameters of the built PID control model, and conducts simulation analysis. The simulation results show that, compared with the passive system before the control, the multisources complex excitations active vibration isolation system under the PID control has the far less peak-to-peak amplitude of acceleration which is transmitted to the foundation and has the much better vibration isolation effect. Finally, the paper conducts experimental verification, which demonstrates that active vibration control effect is identical to the simulation results and the vibration control effect is significantly improved.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2016\/3486959","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,22]],"date-time":"2016-11-22T00:27:54Z","timestamp":1479774474000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"PID Control of Multisources Complex Excitations Active Vibration Isolation System: An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","prefix":"10.1155","volume":"2016","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6811-8273","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Song","family":"Chunsheng","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China"},{"name":"Hubei Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7753-2396","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Jiang","family":"Youliang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2503-1474","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Zhang","family":"Jinguang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China"},{"name":"Hubei Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China"}]}],"member":"98","reference":[{"key":"2","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apacoust.2009.09.005","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"3","DOI":"10.1016\/j.csmssp.2015.03.001","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"4","DOI":"10.1016\/j.conengprac.2012.06.010","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"5","DOI":"10.1016\/j.mechmachtheory.2011.04.010","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"6","volume":"39","issue":"11","first-page":"59","year":"1998","journal-title":"Sea Technology"},{"key":"7","DOI":"10.1063\/1.2930810","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"8","DOI":"10.1016\/S0967-0661(03)00135-7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"10","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jsv.2007.11.045","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"11","volume":"28","first-page":"47","year":"2006","journal-title":"Ship Science and Technology"},{"key":"12","DOI":"10.3901\/jme.2008.02.163","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"13","DOI":"10.1299\/jsmec.49.719","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"14","year":"1993"},{"key":"15","year":"1994"},{"key":"16","DOI":"10.1177\/1077546311433608","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"17","DOI":"10.1177\/1077546313480997","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"18","DOI":"10.1109\/tsmcb.2007.897922","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"19","DOI":"10.1109\/lawp.2013.2283375","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"20","DOI":"10.1016\/j.neucom.2015.04.045","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"22","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ins.2014.11.017","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"23","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jfranklin.2012.06.008","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"24","DOI":"10.1016\/j.asoc.2015.10.041","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"25","volume":"7","issue":"1","first-page":"101","year":"2012","journal-title":"International Journal of Computers Communications & Control","DOI":"10.15837\/ijccc.2012.1.1426","doi-asserted-by":"crossref"},{"key":"26","DOI":"10.1007\/s00034-013-9710-4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"27","DOI":"10.1016\/j.automatica.2007.08.017","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"}],"container-title":"Shock and Vibration","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/sv\/2016\/3486959.pdf","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/sv\/2016\/3486959.xml","content-type":"application\/xml","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/sv\/2016\/3486959.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,25]],"date-time":"2017-06-25T04:08:15Z","timestamp":1498363695000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"references-count":24,"alternative-id":["3486959","3486959"],"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1155\/2016\/3486959","relation":{"cites":[]},"ISSN":["1070-9622","1875-9203"],"container-title-short":"Shock and Vibration"}
