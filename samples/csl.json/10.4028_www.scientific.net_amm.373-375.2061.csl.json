At the same time, the effects of feeding speed, the wind speed and the angle of wind outlet on the performance of the equipment were analyzed, and a mathematical model was established. By taking multi-objective optimization method and response surface method, this paper obtained the conclusion that the best combination conditions of cleaning equipment of ginkgo: the feeding speed was 270.86kg\/h, the wind speed was 9.25m\/s, and the angle of wind outlet was 17\u00b0. Then the cleaning equipment reached the best performance: the loss rate was 1.20%, while the cleaning rate was 95.21%.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/amm.373-375.2061","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,30]],"date-time":"2013-08-30T11:25:40Z","timestamp":1377861940000},"page":"2061-2067","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Experimental Research of the Cleaning Device of Ginkgo","prefix":"10.4028","volume":"373-375","author":[{"given":"Li Hua","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Sichuan Agricultural University"}]},{"given":"Shu Lei","family":"Qiao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Sichuan Agricultural University"}]},{"given":"Xing","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Sichuan Agricultural University"}]},{"given":"Jun","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Sichuan Agricultural University"}]}],"member":"2457","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2013,8]]},"container-title":"Applied Mechanics and Materials","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.scientific.net\/AMM.373-375.2061.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,4]],"date-time":"2018-05-04T11:40:58Z","timestamp":1525434058000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/amm.373-375.2061","relation":{},"ISSN":["1662-7482"],"container-title-short":"AMM"}
