This paper takes a critical look at the assumptions behind this idea, in an effort to understand better the meaning of ethical management decisions.<\/jats:p><jats:p>A distinction is made between stakeholder analysis and stakeholder synthesis. The two most natural kinds of stakeholder synthesis are then defined and discussed: strategic and multi-fiduciary. Paradoxically, the former appears to yield business without ethics and the latter appears to yield ethics without business. The paper concludes by suggesting that a third approach to stakeholder thinking needs to be developed, one that avoids the paradox just mentioned and that clarifies for managers (and directors) the legitimate role of ethical considerations in decision-making.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:disp-quote><jats:p><jats:italic>So we must think through what management should be accountable for; and how and through whom its accountability can be discharged.
