The frame carrying capacity under various actions is related to the absolute stiffness of frame components and relative beam-column line stiffness ratio. The matrix displacement method and programming based on MATLAB were employed in this study to calculate the internal forces and displacements of a 2-bay 2-story frame structure under the action of horizontal loads. The influence of the beam-column line stiffness ratio on the frame load capacity was discussed based on the calculated result. Furthermore some advises were provided about the reasonable beam-column line stiffness ratio for engineering design.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/amm.71-78.4194","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,8,8]],"date-time":"2011-08-08T07:49:51Z","timestamp":1312789791000},"page":"4194-4198","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Study of the Influence of the Beam-Column Line Stiffness Ratio on the Frame Structure Load Capacity Based on MATLAB","prefix":"10.4028","volume":"71-78","author":[{"given":"Shao Qin","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Nanchang HangKong University"}]},{"given":"Hua Hu","family":"Cheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nanchang Hangkong University"}]}],"member":"2457","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2011,7]]},"container-title":"Applied Mechanics and Materials","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.scientific.net\/AMM.71-78.4194.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,4]],"date-time":"2018-05-04T07:34:34Z","timestamp":1525419274000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/amm.71-78.4194","relation":{},"ISSN":["1662-7482"],"container-title-short":"AMM"}
