In colorectal carcinoma, tumoral tissues infiltrate with various immune\/inflammatory cells along their invasive margins and the increased S100A8\/A9 expression in these immune cells infiltrating the tumor has recently been demonstrated. We examined S100A8\/A9 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.<jats:italic>Materials and Methods<\/jats:italic>. The current study included a sample of 80 patients diagnosed with CRC (30 cases with distant metastasis, 30 cases with lymph node metastasis, and 20 cases with no metastasis). Peritumoral and intratumoral S100A8 and S100A9 expressing inflammatory cells were counted in primary tumors and their metastasis and correlated with clinicopathological parameters.<jats:italic>Results<\/jats:italic>. The peritumoral and intratumoral S100A8\/A9 positive cells showed no correlation with age, gender, or depth of tumor invasion. However higher counts of peritumoral and intratumoral S100A8\/A9 positive cells were associated with larger tumor size, higher grade, and the presence of metastasis<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(<\/mml:mo><mml:mi>P<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05<\/mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)<\/mml:mo><\/mml:math>.<jats:italic>Conclusion<\/jats:italic>. Our study also found significantly higher number of S100A8\/A9 positive cells in the tumor microenvironment among patients with large tumor size, high grade, and metastatic disease. Moreover, in our study, we observed that the expression in the tumor metastasis appeared similar to that of primary
